            Legong dance is a classical Balinese dance that has been around since the 19th century. It is said that the Legong Dance was inspired by the dream of a prince who was sick and then met two dancing girls accompanied by the
            strains of gamelan. Legong dance has quite complex movements and is tied to gamelan beats. The musical instrument that accompanies the Legong Dance is called Gamelan Semar Pagulingan. Until now, Bali has various kinds of Legong
            Dance, especially in South Bali. The Legong Dance which is quite popular is Legong Lasem (Kraton) which is played by two legong people and a condong. In addition to this, there are Legong Jobog Dances, Ledog Bawa, Egrets,
            Sudarsana, Smaradahana and others.

          Reog dance is one of the original dances of Ponorogo, East Java, which has been worldwide. This traditional dance is played by a number of men wearing lion head masks crowned with peacock feathers. The weight of this huge mask can
          reach 50 kilograms, you know, Toppers. This traditional dance is said to have been created by Ki Ageng Kutu, a servant of the last Majapahit King, Bra Kertabumi. Ki Ageng Kutu, who later rebelled against the King, used this dance
          as an allusion to the king who he considered corrupt and under Chinese influence. This is shown through the property of singa barong representing the king and peacock feathers on his head symbolizing Chinese influence.

            One of the oldest dances in Bali is known as a welcoming dance for guests or tourists who come to a tourist spot. However, this dance is actually a ritual dance that was originally only performed in temples.234 This dance, which
            can also be performed en masse, is part of the ritual of welcoming the descent of the gods to Earth. Usually pendet dancers wear kemben and golden cloth while holding a bokor, where to put flowers that will be sown. 22. Tari
            Kancet Ledo/Tari Gong (Kutai Kertanegara) This dance from East Kalimantan is known for the beauty of its dance movements and the uniqueness of the clothes and dance equipment worn by dancers. In the original version, the female
            dancers who wear traditional Dayak Kenyah clothing must dance on the gong. That is the reason if this dance is also called as gong dance.

              infrequently, the dance that is usually done by many dancers at once is performed in cultural events abroad. In fact, UNESCO, a scientific, educational and cultural organization under the auspices of the United Nations,
              included tari saman in the list of cultural heritage in need of urgent protection from the UN agency for Education, Science and culture. Saman dance movements are quite difficult to perform because they require speed, accuracy
              and compactness. To be able to dance, a group of saman dancers can practice for weeks or even months, you know Toppers.

          From the west of Sumatra island, precisely in Minangkabau, there is a plate dance that has beautiful movements and rich meaning. Plate dance is a symbol of giving offerings to the creator for the success of the harvest. However,
          in the present time the plate dance has been performed freely in various celebrations. Plate dance is usually performed by 3 to 5 dancers who hold two to three plates in their hands and a small bell bracelet tied to the dancer's
          feet. This flexible and beautiful dance is usually accompanied by strains of traditional Minangkabau musical instruments namely bong and saluang.

            Indang dance or known as Dindin Badindin Dance is a native art of West Sumatra, more precisely the people of Pariaman. This dance is said to be a medium for the spread of Islam by Sheikh Burhanudin in West Sumatra. The
            philosophy of this dance is very close to the Minang culture with Islam. Indang dance is performed with the strains of the Prophet's blessings or poems that contain the value of Islamic teachings. Usually, it is displayed on the
            anniversary of the death of the Prophet's grandson or every 10th of Muharram. Dindin Badindin dance is performed by male dancers with an odd number such as 7, 9, 11, or 13 people. The movement is similar to the Saman dance from
            Aceh, but if Toppers look closely, this dance has a more flexible movement.

          created by West Java artist, H. Suanda and Gugum Gumbira. When danced, Jaipong is usually accompanied by Jaipongan music consisting of gong, harp, drum and rebab.

              In addition to the plate dance, from Minangkabau there is also a candle dance. This dance is usually performed to welcome the 21st night of Ramadan. At that time, dancers will pair women and men, then they dance carrying
              lighted candles on a small plate. The candlelight dance is inspired by the Minangkabau folklore about a girl who was abandoned by her fiance. The girl also lost her engagement ring, then she looked for it everywhere until late
              at night using a candle placed on a plate. Well, the movement of the girl who bends and twists as if dancing is the background for this dance movement. The dancers will move beautifully to keep the candle flame burning.

              From Jawa , precisely in the city of Solo, there is a regional dance that has been known since the days of the Kings of ancient Java, the Gambyong dance. In its development, this dance continues to evolve with a variety of
              choreography. This dance is actually rooted in tayub, a folk dance that is usually played during harvest parties. However, the palace brought this dance and developed it into a flexible dance and full of beautiful movements
              that can anesthetize the eyes.

            Mask dance is a Cirebon regional dance that is very popular in all circles, both among the kraton and commoners. Because of its popularity, Sunan Gunung Jati uses this dance as a propaganda medium when spreading Islam in West
            Java. The mask dancers usually wear 5 different types of masks. Each mask has its own name and character. The panji mask, for example, symbolizes a baby who is still clean from sin, while the pamindo mask is a knight, while the
            patih mask depicts maturity.

          Infatuated dance is a traditional dance art from Lombok danced by female dancers accompanied by a set of gamelan. This dance is usually also performed with poetry and singing. Although the name is similar, infatuated dance from
          Lombok is different from the existing Java and Bali. Very marked differences can be found in both the movements, the costumes and the presentation of the shows. Initially, this dance was used to entertain the soldiers after
          returning from the battlefield. With the accompaniment of several Gamelan instruments, the female dancers dance while inviting the soldiers to dance in pairs.
